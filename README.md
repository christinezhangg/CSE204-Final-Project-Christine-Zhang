# CSE204-Final-Project-Christine-Zhang

Please read this!

This is my final project.  Just to help whoever is grading my assignment, below are some suggestions and information on 
the functionality my platform provides.  

Suggestions:
The API I use asks that you don't make a request too quickly.  If you click the "Discover New Advice" button
super quickly without any pauses, the same "advice" will show up.  So please wait a couple of seconds before each 
request, I think 3 is the magic number they recommended online.  Just don't want you to think it's an error, 
I promise you everything works!

Functionality:
1. A random piece of advice shows up on the home page every time it is reloaded.  
2. All of the buttons work to lead you to a different page.
3. On the "Get New Advice Page", if you try and save advice before you "Discover New Advice", it won't let you.  It will send you an alert suggesting that you "Discover New Advice" before trying to save the advice to your list.  
4. When you save advice to your list, another alert will pop up letting you know that your advice has been successfully saved and guides the user journey by telling them to check out the "View Your Saved Advice" page.  
5. Saving advice to your list works, you can add as many as you'd like and it will populate in the saved list.  

Thank you!  I had a lot of fun in this class!
